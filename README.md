# library
Small library app to track books a user has read.

User is able to enter book information into a form which will then add that book into a library where it can be tracked. The user can additionally toggle to change the read status of the book or delete it from the library entirely.

The library is an array of books and the book themselves are class instances.

First developed to practice using objects, object constructors and prototypes and then refactored slightly to make the Book a class instead.
